# skole_prosjekt

This code was design and made as for the
FINAL PROJECT by me (maria) under the 2 years study of
IT operations and Programming by TISIP Fagskole.


#to enable this code, run:

composer install &&
symfony start:server

#edit and connect your own database from .env file
#den make migrations from the code to your own database

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

Happy Coding!!

With Regards;
Maria Eilertsen
